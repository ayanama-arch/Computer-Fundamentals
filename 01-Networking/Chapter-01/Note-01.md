### **Introduction to Data Communications and Networking**

Data communications refer to the transfer of data between devices via a transmission medium. A communication system must ensure that data reaches the correct destination accurately and on time.

#### **Key Components of a Data Communication System**

1. **Message** – The information being transmitted (text, numbers, images, audio, video).
2. **Sender** – The device that sends the data.
3. **Receiver** – The device that receives the data.
4. **Medium** – The channel through which data is transmitted.
5. **Protocol** – A set of rules governing communication.

#### **Types of Data Flow**

- **Simplex:** One-way communication (e.g., TV broadcast).
- **Half-Duplex:** Two-way communication, but only one direction at a time (e.g., walkie-talkie).
- **Full-Duplex:** Two-way communication simultaneously (e.g., telephone).

#### **Network Basics**

A network is a collection of devices connected by communication links.

1. **Connection Types:**

   - **Point-to-Point:** Dedicated link between two devices.
   - **Multipoint:** A shared link among multiple devices.

2. **Network Topologies:**

   - **Mesh:** Every device connects to every other device.
   - **Star:** Central hub connects all devices.
   - **Bus:** Single backbone cable connects all devices.
   - **Ring:** Devices connected in a closed loop.

3. **Types of Networks:**
   - **Local Area Network (LAN):** Covers a small area like an office or campus.
   - **Wide Area Network (WAN):** Covers large geographical areas, including states or countries.
   - **Internet:** A global network of interconnected networks.

#### **Protocols and Standards**

- A **protocol** defines the rules for data communication (syntax, semantics, timing).
- **Standards** ensure interoperability between devices from different manufacturers.
- Major standardization organizations: **ISO, IEEE, ITU-T, ANSI, EIA**.
- **RFC (Request for Comment):** Documents that lead to Internet standards.

   +---------+      Medium      +---------+
   | Sender  | ---------------> | Receiver |
   +---------+                 +---------+

- Sender transmits data.
- Medium carries the data.
- Receiver receives and processes the data.
